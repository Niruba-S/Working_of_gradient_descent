This repository contains materials explaining the concept and working of Gradient Descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and optimization problems.

# Introduction
Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by moving in the direction of the steepest descent (negative gradient) of the function. It is commonly used to train machine learning models by adjusting the parameters to minimize a cost function.
